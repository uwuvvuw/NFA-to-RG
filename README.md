# NFA-to-RG
Converting Regular Grammars into NFA (as a formal definition with transition table). The subfunctions include a testing strings of up to 5 strings at once can be tested and a statement will be informed to user whether each string can be generated by the RG. Then, converting the epsilon-NFA into an NFA without epsilon-transition (if there is any) and lastly, draw the NFA diagram.

Another function available is converting NFA (as a transition table) into Regular Grammars. The subfunctions include a testing strings of up to 5 strings at once can be tested and a statement will be informed to user whether each string is accepted or rejected NFA.
